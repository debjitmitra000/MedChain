# Filecoin Network Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **Backend**: Added Filecoin Calibration testnet configuration to `.env`
  - `FILECOIN_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1`
  - `FILECOIN_CHAIN_ID=314159`
  - `FILECOIN_EXPLORER_URL=https://calibration.filfox.info`

- **Client**: Added corresponding frontend environment variables
  - `VITE_FILECOIN_RPC_URL`
  - `VITE_FILECOIN_CHAIN_ID=314159`
  - `VITE_FILECOIN_EXPLORER_URL`

### 2. Network Utilities
- **Backend**: Created `/backend/utils/networks.js` with:
  - Multi-network configuration (Filecoin Calibration primary; Sepolia deprecated in docs)
  - Network switching utilities
  - Explorer URL generation
  - Chain ID formatting

- **Client**: Created `/client/src/utils/networks.js` with:
  - MetaMask network switching helpers for Filecoin Calibration
  - Filecoin Calibration set as default chain
  - Network detection by chain ID

### 3. Network Connectivity Testing
- **Test Script**: `/backend/test-networks.js`
  - ‚úÖ **Filecoin Calibration**: Successfully connected (Block height: 3,056,675)
  - ‚ùå **Sepolia**: Failed (RPC URL not configured in environment)

### 4. User Interface Components
Note: A NetworkSelector component was developed during integration but was later removed from the UI by request. Filecoin Calibration is now the default network across the client.

### 5. Admin Dashboard Integration
- Added NetworkSelector to admin control center
- Visual network status display
- Multi-blockchain administration support

## üåê Network Status

| Network | Status | Chain ID | RPC Connectivity |
|---------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Filecoin Calibration** | ‚úÖ Ready | 314159 | ‚úÖ Connected |

## üîß Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test MetaMask integration** with Filecoin Calibration (add chain to wallet if necessary)
2. **Update blockchain service** to ensure consistent currency labeling and explorer links (done)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Smart Contract Deployment** on Filecoin Calibration
2. **Cross-chain batch verification** system
3. **Network-specific transaction handling**
4. **IPFS integration** for Filecoin storage

## üìã Configuration Checklist

- [x] Filecoin testnet RPC endpoint configured
- [x] Network utilities created (backend & frontend)
- [x] NetworkSelector component developed
- [x] Admin dashboard network display
- [x] Connectivity testing completed
- [ ] Sepolia RPC URL configuration
- [ ] MetaMask integration testing

## üöÄ Ready for Multi-Blockchain Operations

The MedChain system now supports:
- **Dual-network architecture** (Ethereum + Filecoin)
- **Dynamic network switching** through MetaMask
- **Visual network management** in admin interface
- **Scalable network configuration** system

The Filecoin Calibration testnet is successfully integrated and ready for blockchain operations!
